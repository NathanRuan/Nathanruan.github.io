Creating this portfolio was a very challenging task for me. The inspiration for this portfolio came from my childhood dream of becoming an ice cream store owner. That's why I created this website to introduce my customers or followers to what I'm doing. To introduce my ideas and the team of my store.
I even provide a way for visitors to contact me at the end of the page to upload their information.
The biggest difficulty I had in creating the site was my inability to become proficient in using a framework like bootstrap. bootstrap provides a very convenient way for developers to build websites. Unfortunately, most of the time I was exposed to a very traditional and archaic way of writing code, and I was not familiar with this new way of building code that I was exposed to. That's why I don't use bootstrap a lot in this portfolio.
After a lot of browsing tutorials and trying and practicing, I was finally able to use some elements of bootstrap in my portfolio. Also, a lot of work with animated elements and using flex layouts has allowed me to become more proficient with these techniques
